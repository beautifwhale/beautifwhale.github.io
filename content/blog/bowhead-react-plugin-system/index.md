What is a Micro-Saas? 

> "A SaaS business targeting a niche market, run by one person or a very small team, with small costs, a narrow focus, a small but dedicated user base and no outside funding. Hence, micro-SaaS." - Tylar Tringas

I've built numerous Saas products keeping to the ideas behind Micro-Saas. Some I started and never finished and some I launched but they failed to gain any traction. Through these experiments I've learned a little about marketing, customer success, design, planning, delivery, business management, and persistence. I have yet to build a product that is "successful" but it's only a matter of time.

For each of these MVEs (Minimum Viable Experiments) I've found myself implementing some key features over and over again, such as user authentication, database integrations, payment processing, landing pages, and dashboards. Bowhead is an attempt to solve this problem.

In this article I'll talk about some of the interesting challenges I encountered while building Bowhead, some lessons I've learned along the way, and why I consider this another failed experiment.

## Bowhead

Naming things is hard, I like whales, so this project was named Bowhead.

> The bowhead whale is a species of baleen whale belonging to the family Balaenidae and the only living representative of the genus Balaena. It is the only baleen whale endemic to the Arctic and subarctic waters.

Bowhead is a project to make the initial setup of a Micro-Saas product a little easier by providing a Create React App template with some basic features already implemented. 

## Planning

Bowhead has to have a good developer experience, if it's difficult to set up and configure developers will not use it.

As a **developer**:

- I want to download my upvoted content so that I can review it (required)
- I want to download my saved content so that I can review it (required)
- I want to view my data in Excel so that I can review it (required)
- I want to read some documentation that will help me setup the tool (required)
- I want to download only my latest Reddit data so that I'm not downloading all of my data each time I run the tool (required)
- I want to download my comments content so that I can review it (nice to have)
- I want to download my submissions content so that I can review it (nice to have)
- I want to format my data as JSON, txt, or CSV (nice to have)
